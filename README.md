Coil Simulator Software

Purpose: To assist in the optimization of the coils that will be used in the cubes project. These will require very specific amounts of force and as a result simulations are being run so that we can optimize for the proper coil geometry before we waste immense amounts of time buiding many variations of our coils. 

Objectives:

1. Calculate Coil Inductance
2. Calculate Coil Resistance (For different metals, and diameters)
3. Calculate Magnetic Field Surrounding Our Coils and Plot
4. Calculate Repulsive force between Coils
5. Make Plots of Voltage vs. Force Generated to assist in choosing coil design required.
